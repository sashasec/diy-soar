# diy-soar
Similar to the "Wouldn't it be nice" series - but connecting technologies together into a single driver script. 
Adapted and re-written a number of times since 2019. The novel idea is that with a few select `requests` methods interacting with technology APIs, lists, dictionaries, and conditionals - you can get A LOT done with very little. End result is Very SOAR-esque (Security Orchestration and Response).
